#### ToDo:
* Autoexits: think about show room's name  instead of "Too dark to tell" if player has the light (the same as Mu's infravision of Implementor's Holylight).
* Command prompt: disable EXP output if player's level >=31
* Movement: Speedwalk
* Equipment & Fight: two-handed combat (I don't really know if I'm going to do it ^^)
